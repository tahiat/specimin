/**
 * This test demonstrates the imprecision of SpecSlice when there are two or more synthetic classes
 * with the same name. If only one or some of them extend Throwable, SpecSlice will imprecisely make
 * all of them extend Throwable. This occurs due to SpecSlice becoming confused when faced with
 * multiple synthetic classes sharing the same name. This imprecision is caused by the fact that
 * SpecSlice uses javac's error messages to determine which synthetic types need to extend Throwable,
 * but javac only prints simple names in its error messages.
